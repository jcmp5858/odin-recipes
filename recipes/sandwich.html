        <p>Of all the recipes, this one was the most difficult to find a picture for. They were all too dessert-like or too healthy-looking. 
            This staple of a Martin Sibling hodge-podge lunch is untrodden-upon territory! That's the way to think of it. 
        </p>
        <p> As promised, this is also simple, though it does require scouring the back of the pantry and cupboards for some forgotten chocolate chips. 
            Never fear, dad might have hidden them in the garage so don't forget to check there.</p>
            <h3> Ingredients</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Peanut Butter (what else did you expect?)</li>
                <li> Chocolate Chips (the tricky part)</li>
                <li> Bread (yes, even the ends)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3> Instructions</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> First, slather peanut butter on the split-top wheat bread. </li>
                <li> Next, sprinkle a proportionate amount of chocolate chips onto the peanut butter. Be careful, if you put too many on both sides of the bread, it will more easily fall apart and become Casey's sandwich instead of yours. </li>
                <li> Finally, close the two halves! Repeat per number of siblings. </li>
            </ol>
