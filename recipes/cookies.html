            If you've ever read the book <em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em>, you've probably wondered what the recipe was.
            At the back of the book, they have 2 cookie recipes. The first, naturally, requires chocolate chips, as most of the illustrations depict those cookies. 
            However, if you are hankering for some cookies and find the cupboards rather bare, these are almost as delicious! However, milk is strongly recommended.
        </p>
        <p> The main appeal of these cookies is that they only require 3 ingredients. So, especially if your family always has a healthy stock of peanut butter, like mine did growing up, 
            then you can almost always enjoy these cookies whenever the craving strikes.

        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <p> As promised, there are only 3</p>
        <ol> 
            <li> peanut butter </li>
            <li> sugar </li>
            <li> an egg </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> First, mix together <strong> 1 cup</strong> of peanut butter,
            <strong> 1 cup </strong> of sugar, and <strong> an </strong> egg.</li>
            <li>Use a tablespoon to plop the batter on a cookie tray, if you managed to refrain from eating it all.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 15-20 minutes. This step takes the longest, so it is best to sit by the oven door while waiting so you don't get distracted. </li>
        </ol>
