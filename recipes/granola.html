       <p> I love granola bars, but they can quickly get expensive even if you buy the store brand versions. 
        Plus, when they are on sale, the varieties you love quickly are out of stock. This recipe will save 
    you money and frustration!</p>
     <p>When you eat one of these granola bars, you won't even be able to tell that they are healthy. 
        The chocolate chips and honey balance out the potentially bitter dried cranberries, 
        while the peanut butter and almond flour add plenty of protein to keep you feeling full.</p>
